I"§<p>Over last few years we have done lots of great work. We have worked hard and learned even harder. We meet along the way and have stuck together working tirelessly to better each other.</p>

<p>We believe that great things are simple, complex in nature but simple in execution. Itâ€™s why we do things we do, make hard things look easy.</p>

<p>And to that notion we arrived at an idea to share what we have learned with people who are interested.</p>

<p>We believe that what we know so far will put you in a position that your starting point is not zero but a way ahead on the curve.</p>

<p>We tried to make complex patterns simplified for understanding so that you can start small but still grow large without full rebuilds.</p>

<p>Some of the content and concepts you may see unnecessary at the start of your journey but its something that will be harder to introduce once you are on your way so bear with it at the start.</p>
